  <h3><b>where are we?</b></h3>
  <p>in 2020 the bands once record label went out of business which resulted in the bands entire discography being
    completely purged from all music streaming services until October 2021, when the Sargent House Records announced
    that they had acquired Botch's full catalogue and would "maintain the band's digital presence as well as future
    vinyl represses in the future" which created speculation amongst the fanbase for a future reunion. Each member went
    on to say that this was purely just going to be for the purpose of keeping their records in print and that "you
    shouldn't expect any new music from us." until August 24, 2022 when Botch released the single <i>“One Twenty
